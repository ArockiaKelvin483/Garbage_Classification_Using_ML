# Garbage_Classification_Using_ML

## Overview

This project aims to classify images of garbage into different categories using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify and categorize various types of waste, promoting efficient recycling processes.
## Features

- **Image Classification:** The model classifies images into different categories such as organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable waste.

## Hints:
use garbage.zip for using the trained model of garbage (Garbage.h5)
